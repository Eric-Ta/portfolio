              Reflecting on my computer science experience and thinking about my future career goals, I decided 
              to shift away from this path to work in a field where I can provide a positive influence into the 
              future. Teaching is the answer to this, giving me the opportunity to teach education curriculum, and more
              importantly, teaching the youth valuable life lessons.

              I'm passionate about creating a positive influence on the future of society, which will be accomplished
              during my career as a teacher. I decided to get a computer science degree because of my love of problem solving 
              and technology, both of which I will continue to use in my teaching career (and the rest of my life).

              I was born and raised in Calgary and currently residing here! During my free time away from education and work, I love maintaing an active lifestyle! I love to play tennis, 
              golf, basketball, run, and workout. My favourite sports teams are the Calgary Flames, San Francisco 49ers, and the Los Angeles 
              Clippers. I am also a massive film connoisseur watching just about everything from old classics to the latest and greatest blockbusters!

                    We are always learning! 
                    Becoming a teacher will put me on the other side of learning as I teach to the future! 
                    I feel it is important to introduce to students the concept that learning never stops. 
                    Learning doesnâ€™t end when the bell rings at the end of the day and that anything in life can be a learning lesson. 
                    This concept took longer than I wanted to grasp with me and I want to make sure all my students are aware of this at a young age!

                    Throughout school, work, sports, and life in general, I have learned that working in a team setting is crucial for success. 
                    Having strong communication, leadership, accountability, respect, and other collaboration and teamwork skills is crucial for success. 
                    You can be a very knowledgable person, but without the proper teamwork skills, it can handicap your potential in the future. 
                    I want to have as many collaboration activities as possible when I am a teacher, 
                    so these teamwork skills can develop and hopefully lay a solid foundation for the future.

                  <p className="text-muted-foreground">
                    Throughout my time in school, many of the lessons that stood out to me involved practical application. 
                    Activities such as field trips (outdoor learning, zoo, science centre), French cafe, evaluating political parties (at grade 6! Woah!), 
                    and what we would spend $10 million dollars on in 24 hours. 
                    These activities are all related to concepts we learned in class, but applied to the real world, which provided more interest for many, 
                    knowing what we can directly apply our learning on. 
                    I want to try to connect every lesson with how the concept may be used in the real world, so students have a deeper connection with the lesson, 
                    and not feel like they are wasting time learning curriculum.
